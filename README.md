# AXI Protocol Verification using SystemVerilog UVM

This project demonstrates functional verification of an AXI protocol interface, implemented entirely using SystemVerilog and UVM. The goal is to showcase protocol-level verification skills, reusable verification IP (VIP), and professional-grade verification methodology.

---

**Overview**

- **Protocol:** AMBA AXI (AXI4)
- **Verification Methodology:** Universal Verification Methodology (UVM)
- **Language:** SystemVerilog
- **Target Simulators:** QuestaSim / VCS / ModelSim

The verification environment covers AXI protocol compliance, transaction-level stimulus generation, functional coverage, assertions, and corner-case scenario verification.

---

**Key Highlights**

- Complete AXI VIP developed using UVM methodology.
- UVM components: Driver, Monitor, Sequencer, Agent, Scoreboard, and Environment.
- Constrained-random stimulus for both read and write channels.
- Functional coverage models ensuring protocol correctness and coverage closure.
- Assertions (SystemVerilog SVA) to validate protocol properties.
- Easy extensibility for future AXI protocol extensions.
